Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key milestones: 1968: The first NATO Software Engineering Conference is held. 1970s: A number of new methodologies are developed, including structured programming and object-oriented programming. 1980s: The first computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools are released

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
A full SDLC has 7 basic stages: Planning, requirements, design and prototype, software development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. In some cases, depending on different variables (project, team, manager, etc.), certain steps can be omitted, split, or combined.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is ideal if your project has stable and clearly defined requirements that are unlikely to change. This method ensures that all aspects of the project are well documented and followed precisely. Agile should be considered when requirements are unclear or expected to evolve.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The developer is responsible for writing the code and developing the entire software product. Aside from coding, a software developer is responsible for sending updates to the project manager and working closely with other team members, including the designer and QA engineer.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Many IDEs include integrated version control systems like Git. These systems allow developers to track changes, commit updates, and merge code efficiently. IDEs with these features enhance teamwork by integrating these control systems directly into your development workflow.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    Lack of Workflow Visibility. ...
    Broken SDLC Processes. ...
    Lack of Predictability In Software Delivery. ...
    The Problems With Development Velocity. ...
    Scalability, Security, and Performance Challenges. ...
    Developer Burnout, and a Struggling People Well-Being.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Integration testing verifies how individual software components (modules) work together after being unit-tested. It focuses on ensuring individual software pieces. In this level of testing, two or more unit-tested modules are integrated to test technique-interacting components.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models' training data. Further, it enhances the user-AI interaction so the AI understands the user's intention even with minimal input.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A specific and concise prompt: "Explain the concept of transfer learning in the context of computer vision." In this example, the vague prompt asks for general information about artificial intelligence, which could result in a broad and lengthy response.
